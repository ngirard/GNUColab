# **GNU Colab**

*In here we set an environment in which you can persistently run desktop programs.*

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ngirard/GNUColab/blob/master/gnucolab.ipynb)

This notebook lets you **run desktop programs on colab machines** drawn on your local terminal through VNC.

To be more precise, this notebook sets up a *regular* remote personal computer, with users and configurations preserved even when the machine turns off.

Actually, an instance on which this notebook has been run has become capable of editing itself, so you can even use it to avoid having machines dying of idling.

At this moment, the notebook is pre-configured to run either **MATE** or **XFCE**.
